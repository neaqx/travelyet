In my development process, I opted to utilize VSCode as my text editor. My choice in using VSCode stems from my prior experience with this editor. I have previously worked with VSCode and am familiar with its functionalities. Additionally, I have configured Git locally for direct GitHub integration, facilitating the process of pushing code to the repository.
